			<p>Hello! <br> I am Akash Meshram.
			A recent graduate of IIT Kharagpur interested in interdisciplinary technology and lover of the color blue. I have experiences in Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, IoT and Materials Science. I aspire to use my skills to create better human experiences and integration with the natural world. <!-- Visual intuition and engineering education are key ingredients of my work. --> In my free time, I enjoy searching for the historical facts, travelling, admiring tech and consuming samosa.<!-- I'm currently moving my works from forgotten drive folders to this (hopefully) much more organized site, so bear with me please! --> I'm currently looking for full time positions for after graduation in 2020. I always consider design and engineering as vital aspect of my career and I always look for learning opportunities.
