			<p>Hello! <br> I am Akash Meshram.
			A recent graduate of IIT Kharagpur interested in interdisciplinary technology and lover of the color blue. I have experiences in Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, IoT and Materials Science. Better human experiences and integration with the natural world are key components of my work. <!-- Visual intuition and engineering education are key ingredients of my work. --> In my free time, I enjoy searching for the historical facts, travelling, admiring tech and consuming samosa.<!-- I'm currently moving my works from forgotten drive folders to this (hopefully) much more organized site, so bear with me please! --> I'm currently working as Software Developer at YourStory Media. I always consider design and engineering as vital aspects of my career and I always look for learning opportunities.
